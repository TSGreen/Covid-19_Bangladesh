# Covid-19_Bangladesh
A data visualisation project exploring Bangladesh's Covid-19 data.

The two main strands are a time-series analysis of the nationwide figures and a geospatial analysis of the cases per adminsitrative disrict. 

The geospatial data is scrapped from the goverment's IEDCR webpage.

The time-series data is scrapped from a Wikipedia table (which I help to maintain) of the daily press release numbers.


<h2>Interactive web-app</h2>

The visualtions from this project have been deployed as a web-app available [here on Heroku](https://bangladesh-covid19.herokuapp.com/). Note it is deployed on Heroku's free tier so may take some time to wake from sleep. Please be patient! 

The code for the app deployment is avaiable in [this repository](https://github.com/TSGreen/bd-covid19-dash-app).
